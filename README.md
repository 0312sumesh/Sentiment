# Sentiment

#Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive sentiment analysis project using a Twitter dataset. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and a novel Hybrid model that combines the strengths of both approaches. This exploration seeks to accurately discern sentiment within tweets and assess the effectiveness of different methodologies in doing so.

#Background
Social media platforms are vital for understanding public sentiment. This project utilizes sentiment analysis to help businesses, researchers, and decision-makers gain insights from Twitter data. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, uses computational techniques to identify the emotional tone and subjective information in textual data.

#Methodologies
The project utilizes three core techniques:

Decision Trees for Feature Selection: Uses a Decision Tree classifier to select the most informative features from the Twitter data.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Implements an RNN with LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies and contextual information.
Hybrid Model: Combines outputs from the Decision Tree and RNN models to enhance accuracy and interpretability.
